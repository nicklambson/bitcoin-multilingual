## Why localize-bitcoin

"Bitcoin is a strange game where the only winning move is to play." @bitstein

Do the people in other countries know they are in the middle of the game?

"I really think that in many ways, **Bitcoin, at least for now, is too English language centric** and Western development centric to really be able to offer that relief valve." - Andreas Antonopolous 

localize-bitcoin aims to ignite Bitcoin's unstoppable global game theory by localizing Bitcoin information and tools into as many languages as possible.

Three things everyone around the world should know in their own tongue:
1. Understand bitcoin
2. Self-custody bitcoin
3. Run a full node

I once hosted a website called localizebitcoin.com, but since took it offline due to other life responsibilities. But I've re-uploaded my translation memory and terminology data to this repository. The links below are somewhat outdated, but direct translators to worthwhile Bitcoin development projects.
